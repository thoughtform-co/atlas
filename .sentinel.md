## 🔄 State Management in SSR/Client Environments

### The Hydration Problem

Next.js (and similar frameworks) render on server first, then hydrate on client. State that exists server-side may not be immediately available client-side.

**Pattern: Use a `mounted` guard for client-only state**

```typescript
const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => setMounted(true), []);

// Only trust client-side state after mounting
if (!mounted) return <LoadingState />;
```

**Why it matters:** Without this, you get hydration mismatches where the server renders one thing and the client expects another.

---

### Multiple Loading States

When a feature depends on multiple async operations (e.g., session + role + data), gate on ALL of them:

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Only checks one loading state
if (loading) return null;
if (isAdmin) showAdminUI();

// ✅ GOOD: Waits for everything to resolve
if (loading || roleLoading) return null;
if (isAdmin) showAdminUI();
```

**Why it matters:** Partial loading states cause UI to flash incorrect content before all dependencies resolve.

---

## ⚡ useEffect Dependencies

### The Stale Closure Problem

Effects with incomplete dependencies create stale closures. If an effect reads state, that state should be in deps.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Empty deps means this only runs once, even if isAdmin changes later
useEffect(() => {
  if (isAdmin) drawAdminIcon();
}, []);

// ✅ GOOD: Effect re-runs when relevant state changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (isAdmin) drawAdminIcon();
}, [isAdmin]);
```

**Canvas and animation components are especially vulnerable** - they draw once on mount and never update if deps are missing.

---

### API Call Storms

Multiple effects calling the same API create race conditions and unnecessary load.

**Pattern: Single-source-of-truth**

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Three places calling the same API
useEffect(() => { fetchUserRole(); }, []);
useEffect(() => { if (user) fetchUserRole(); }, [user]);
onAuthStateChange(() => { fetchUserRole(); });

// ✅ GOOD: One effect owns the API call
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) fetchUserRole();
}, [user]);
```

**Principles:**
- Identify ONE effect responsible for each API call
- Other effects should read from state, not trigger new fetches
- Use refs or flags if you need to prevent duplicate calls during initialization

---

## 🔐 Async Operations

### The Null Check Narrowing Issue

TypeScript doesn't maintain null narrowing across await boundaries:

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: TypeScript can't guarantee client is still non-null after await
const client = getClient();
if (!client) return;
const data = await client.getData(); // TS error possible

// ✅ GOOD: Capture in const immediately after check
const client = getClient();
if (!client) return;
const safeClient = client; // Now safely narrowed
const data = await safeClient.getData();
```

**Why it matters:** In async functions, control flow analysis resets after `await`. Capture narrowed values in local constants.

---

## 🎨 Component Patterns

### Conditional Rendering with Multiple Conditions

When a component depends on multiple conditions, be explicit about the "not ready" states:

```typescript
// Pattern for auth-dependent UI
{mounted && !loading && !roleLoading && isAdmin && (
  <AdminButton />
)}
```

**Why it matters:** Each condition represents a potential state where the component shouldn't render. Being explicit prevents flash-of-wrong-content.

---

### Event Handler Timing

For dropdown menus and similar UI, be aware of event order: `mousedown → blur → click`

```typescript
// If dropdown closes on blur, the click might not fire
// Use onMouseDown for critical actions, or prevent blur
onMouseDown={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Prevents blur from firing
  handleAction();
}}
```

**Why it matters:** Click events fire after blur. If blur closes the dropdown, the click target disappears before the click completes.

---

## 🎯 CSS Considerations

### Cross-Browser Support

Always include vendor prefixes for newer CSS features:

```css
backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(12px); /* Safari */
```

### Z-Index Layering

Document z-index values when they matter:

```css
/* z-index layers:
   0: base content
   1: overlays, tooltips
   100: sticky elements
   1000+: navigation, modals */
```

**Why it matters:** Undocumented z-index creates "z-index wars" where developers keep incrementing to fix stacking issues.

---

## 🐛 Debugging Patterns

### Console Logging for State Flows

For complex state flows (auth, async operations), add tagged logs:

```typescript
console.log('[Auth] Session loaded:', session?.user?.email);
console.log('[Auth] Role resolved:', role);
console.log('[Data] Fetch complete:', data.length, 'items');
```

**Production:** Remove or guard with environment check:

```typescript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  console.log('[Auth] Role resolved:', role);
}
```

## 📁 Structural Best Practices

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

For significant decisions, create a `docs/decisions/` folder:

```
docs/decisions/
├── README.md
├── 001-auth-state-pattern.md
├── 002-api-error-handling.md
└── ...
```

Each ADR documents:
- **Context:** What problem did we face?
- **Decision:** What did we decide?
- **Consequences:** What are the trade-offs?

### Code Comments: WHY, not WHAT

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Describes what the code does (obvious)
// Set loading to false
setLoading(false);

// ✅ GOOD: Explains why this approach was chosen
// Must set loading false BEFORE role resolution starts,
// otherwise UI shows "Loading..." during role fetch
setLoading(false);
setRoleLoading(true);
```

## ⚠️ What NOT to Prescribe

These guidelines are about **preventing bugs**, not about:

- Specific visual designs (layouts, colors, animations)
- Component structure choices
- Naming conventions beyond clarity
- Library or framework preferences
- Any pattern that limits creative problem-solving

**Design decisions belong in component-level documentation, not global rules.**

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before submitting code that involves:

### Auth/Session State
- [ ] Gating on ALL loading states before checking permissions?
- [ ] Using `mounted` guard for client-only rendering?
- [ ] Only ONE code path calling each auth-related API?

### useEffect
- [ ] All read state variables in dependency array?
- [ ] No duplicate API calls from multiple effects?
- [ ] Canvas/animation effects include visual state deps?

### Async Operations
- [ ] Null checks captured in local const before await?
- [ ] Loading states set appropriately before/after?
- [ ] Error handling for all await calls?

### UI Components
- [ ] Multiple conditions explicitly gated?
- [ ] Event handler timing considered (mousedown vs click)?
- [ ] Cross-browser CSS prefixes included?
